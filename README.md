Literally just summons a youtube video after you say his name 3x spoken unbroken, and makes sure you enter one of the "WHOLE BEING DEAD THING" lyrics. It's untested, but i was using GPT to be a nerd.

Youtube video it uses: [Whole Being dead Thing PT2 ANIMATIC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHL4qwwyxw)

Literally the code may NOT even work, I don't know python myself, i tend to patch and go via GPT, so I was just literally having fun. 

Anyone else wanna toy with this for kicks go right ahead!

Right now it doesn't seem to work, and GPT tends to tell me that it's 100% correct, but maybe it's just because Beetlejuice DOES exist, and he doesn't want to be summoned by python.

...Or i'm just dumb.
