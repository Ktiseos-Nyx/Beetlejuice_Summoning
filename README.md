# Summon a Demon: Say his name 3 times... and get ready for the show!

This fun little script summons a YouTube video of "The Whole Being Dead Thing" from the Beetlejuice musical after you say his name (Beetlejuice) three times. Once Beetlejuice has been summoned, an image of him will appear with a message saying "It's Showtime!!", and after a short delay, a YouTube video will launch!

YouTube video it uses: [Whole Being dead Thing PT2 ANIMATIC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHL4qwwyxw)

This project was conceived by myself, with coding assistance from Google Gemini. It's a silly, fun project just for kicks.

Feel free to use and toy around with this code if you feel so inclined. 

The image included is NOT mine, I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR IT. 

This is literally like your old school "EXE" type files that would pop your CD drive open for a coke can holder.

It's video loading function is just popping up a youtube URL, i dont know how to make it safer than that lol.
